            <img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/03/India-Australia.jpg" class="news-images" />
            <p class="news-para">
               With Sri Lanka losing the first Test against New Zealand in the two-match series, Australia and India have been locked in as the 2023 World Test Championship finalists, despite the Ahmedabad Test having ended in a draw.
On their tour of New Zealand, Sri Lanka had a possibility to pip India and join Australia in the final at The Oval, London starting June 7. This, only if they could have won the series 2-0, and India didn’t win the final Test in Ahmedabad. Two wins in New Zealand would’ve propelled Sri Lanka’s points percentage (PCT) to 61.11. Whereas, if India are unable to win the fourth Test to Australia, their PCT would be 58.79 or lesser depending on the outcome. With the result in Christchurch being a two wicket win for New Zealand, the permutation and combinations have been thrown out of the window.
                Chasing 285 on the final day, New Zealand batters approached a win with Kane Williamson scoring a century in the second innings at the Hagley Oval. With eight runs needed off the last over, New Zealand would seal the game on the last ball of the day with two wickets in hand.

            <img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/03/Bumrah-Pandya.jpg" class="news-images" />
            <p class="news-para">
               Jasprit Bumrah hasn’t played a game for India since September 2022. A recurring back injury that first took him out of action after the India tour of England last year, ruled him out of the T20 World Cup in Australia and has put a big question over his fitness ahead of the ODI World Cup later this year.
Stand in captain for the first ODI against Australia on Friday, Hardik Pandya however, believes it doesn’t affect India’s strength in the pace bowling department.
 “Jassi hasn’t been around for a quite some now,” he said in the pre-match press conference on Thursday. “The bowling group, we have been doing a decent job. They’re all experienced now….the number of games they have played. Having Jassi makes a massive difference but to be very honest, we aren’t much bothered because the guys who have taken role of Jassi, I am quite confident they’ll be doing very well. It gives us good confidence.”

            <p class="news-para">
               Lionel Messi is reportedly set to be offered 220 million euros per season to match Cristiano Ronaldo’s earnings and to move to Saudi Arabia, the Marca has reported.
Al-Hilal are preparing a similar offer for Messi as they attempt to lure Lionel Messi to Riyadh from PSG, where his contracts end at the end of this season. 
                Ronaldo may have joined Al Nassr for two and a half seasons, but Messi will be offered a one-year contract.
However, Al-Hilal are currently serving a transfer ban, but will be free to sign Messi in the summer, and the Saudi government is also prepared to change salary cap laws to facilitate the arrival of the World Cup winner.
                Meanwhile, Jorge Messi, his father and agent, was spotted in Riyadh on Tuesday and it has added fuel to the ongoing transfer speculation.

            <img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/03/chhetri-1200.jpg" class="news-images" />
            <p class="news-para">
               Talismanic striker Sunil Chhetri “may be playing the last season” of his illustrious career, feels Indian football team head coach Igor Stimac, who is hoping that his star player would be saving his best for the last in the coming months.
India’s next big assignment is the AFC Asian Cup in Qatar from January 12 to February 10 next year. The 38-year-old Chhetri is set to play in his third continental showpiece, the most by an Indian, after playing a pivotal role in the qualification tournament here last year.
“At his age, this will probably be his farewell from football. Obviously, Sunil may be playing his last season, and definitely his last Asian Cup,” Stimac said.
“I’m quite sure that the upcoming months will be the best for Sunil Chhetri,” he was quoted as saying in the official All India Football Federation (AIFF) website.
The national team is currently having a five-day camp here ahead of the Tri-Nation Football Tournament in Imphal from March 22.
Chhetri, the third most prolific international goal scorer among active players with 84 strikes behind Cristiano Ronaldo (118) and Lionel Messi (98), was part of the Indian teams that featured in the 2011 and 2019 Asian Cup.
                The 38-year-old Chhetri, who made his international debut in 2005, played a key role in Bengaluru FC making to Indian Super League final to be played on Saturday.

            <img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/03/Kohli-37.jpg" class="news-images" />
            <p class="news-para">
               Virat Kohli was unbeaten on 59 at stumps on Saturday. For any game in India, this is one line that means so much to so many. For the broadcaster, it’s a reason to whip up a frenzy to bait the viewers to stay tuned. For the local organisers, it guarantees increased footfalls. For the security agencies, it means a busy day and for the pav bhaji sellers outside the stadium, it’s a clear signal to order extra pavs.
In India, there aren’t many better options for a Sunday outing than to watch Kohli bat and possibly score his much-awaited 28th Test 100. A possible sequel to Day 1, when Ahmedabad turned up in hordes to fill the seats to watch the PMs, can be expected on Day 4. This time the reason for the trip to the stadium will be purely cricketing.
                Pundits have a habit of overusing the cliche ‘the first session will be crucial’ at the end of the day’s play. They can be justified for using it after Day 3. At 289/3, India still trail by 191 runs. With runs on board and wickets in hand, Rohit Sharma’s team can be expected to push the pedal on Sunday. For that, they will need Kohli to be around.

               Max Verstappen picked up where he left off in 2022 as he took the chequered flag at the season-opening Bahrain GP, with Sergio Perez helping to secure a Red Bull one-two. The F1 off-season had hinted that Red Bull's dominance would continue, and that was the case in the Gulf as Verstappen's pace saw him keep the rest of the field at arm's length.
               Fernando Alonso starred in finishing third.
                Max Verstappen got his Formula 1 title defence off to the ideal start in Sakhir, as the Red Bull driver took the chequered flag to seal his first victory at the Bahrain International Circuit and get his 2023 season up and running.
His teammate Sergio Perez finished in second, with Aston Martin’s Fernando Alonso sealing a superb third-placed finish on his first race for his new team.
It was an indifferent weekend for Mercedes, as Lewis Hamilton and George Russell finished in fifth and seventh respectively.
                DRIVER OF THE DAY - FERNANDO ALONSO
                It was a dream day for the 41-year-old, who produced some fantastic moments on track with some important overtakes to overcome a difficult start and finish on the podium on his first race for Aston Martin. It is his first podium finish since the 2021 Qatar Grand Prix.
Throughout the weekend, Alonso showcased the pace of the Aston Martin, and topped the timesheets in practice. It was clear that the team had made a massive step forward. However, starting the race from 5th, the thought was that the Aston Martin would eventually succumb to the pace of the Mercedes cars behind, but that proved not to be the case.
The Spaniard was clearly happy with how the car felt during the race, and this may be the springboard that the team needs to challenge the teams at the front of the grid for further podiums.

            <h1 class="news-heading">Why the WEC's eagerly-anticipated new era is unmissable</h1>
            <img src="https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/styles/content_details/public/news/main_image/2023-wec_prologue-fpm-mh-9642_hd.jpg?itok=2oL_VLeD" class="news-images" />
            <p class="news-para">
               After more than three years of expectancy, the new era of sportscar racing finally dawns as this week’s Sebring 1000 Miles kicks off the 2023 World Endurance Championship season. Here’s what all the excitement is about
                This is it! The start! It wasn’t the Daytona 24 Hours in January any more than it was the Spa 6 Hours nearly two years ago. The much-heralded golden era of sportscar racing finally begins with this week’s opening round of the World Endurance Championship at Sebring.

There have been Le Mans Hypercars racing since the opening round of the 2021 WEC, and LMDh machinery came on stream with this year’s IMSA SportsCar Championship curtain-raiser in January. But the Sebring 1000 Miles on Friday is the first time that they will race together. Convergence has finally arrived after more than three years of hype.

That golden era, brave new world or whatever you want to call it is founded on the ability of racing cars built to two different cost-effective rulesets to compete in both the world’s most important sportscar series and at the big races associated with them, the Le Mans 24 Hours and Daytona included.
                It explains why there are five major manufacturers competing in the Hypercar class of the WEC this year – that’s Toyota, Ferrari, Porsche, Peugeot and Cadillac – and more to come. And that’s not counting the fledging car makers in the fight, the likes of Glickenhaus, Vanwall and possibly Isotta Fraschini, which for the moment are best described as garagistes.
          That’s why what some might argue is a support race to the Sebring 12 Hours IMSA round on Saturday is one of the most important moments in the history of endurance racing. The 1000 Miles is at once a landmark moment and a test of the so-called convergence process that has laid the foundations for what is to come.

We should be shouting about it, and not just because Ferrari and Porsche are back at the front of the prototype field after 50 and five years respectively with striking-looking machinery made possible by the new rules. There haven’t been this many manufacturers duking it out at the front of the grid for yonks.

The arrival of BMW, already racing in a class known as GTP in IMSA, Lamborghini and Alpine in 2024 will push the total of OEMs up to eight. It could be nine if Acura, winner at Daytona with its LMDh, expands its programme, most likely under the flag of parent company Honda. That would mean an unprecedented number of car companies represented at the front of the prototype grid.
           The present iteration of the WEC peaked at four OEMs in LMP1, and then only for one race: when Nissan’s disastrous front-wheel-drive GT-R NISMO LM made a belated debut at Le Mans in 2015 before being consigned to the dustbin. In the days before the rebirth of the WEC in 2012 you have to go back to Le Mans 2001 to find as many major marques competing for outright victory as this year.


And the WEC has and will have all the right manufacturers. You only have to add up their Le Mans victories to understand that. Porsche has 19, Ferrari nine, Toyota five and Peugeot three, so the total stands at 36. It will increase to 38 next year on the entry of BMW and Alpine, or rather 39 on the likely assumption that the winner of the 2023 running of the event hangs around for 2024.
                Had Audi pushed on with its LMDh programme announced in November 2020 and canned early last year, that number would have topped 50!

                Between Rohit Sharma's classic in the city of oranges to Virat's superfluous knock at Ahmedabad, there were a few captivating moments that magnified the glory of this keenly contested series. The rise of Murphy, the persistence of Lyon, the doggedness of Khawaja, the astuteness of Ashwin, the batting prowess of Axar, the sheer metronomy from Jadeja and the pristineness of Gill were a few other highlights of the series. Players like Labuschagne and Smith didn't leave much of a mark on the series. But knowledge wise have gone back richer. India have won this 2-1 but were made to work really hard for it as was the case back in 2017. So, India have ended their red ball campaign for this season. The next season post the IPL will begin with the WTC final in early days of June. These two will again cook a recipe for a masterclass. Till then our team of <strong>Kumar Abhisekh, Pradeep Krishnamurthy, MS Ramakrishnan </strong>and <strong>Siva bids</strong> you ta ta! But yeah just like the cameos from this series, the smooth coverage won't have been possible without<strong> Sagar Chawla, Nikhil JD </strong> and<strong> Akshay Maanay </strong>. Enough! <br />
                <br /> <strong>Last four Border-Gavaskar trophy series</strong><br />
                2016/17, India: India won 2-1<br />
                2018/19, Australia: India won 2-1<br />
                2020/21, Australia: India won 2-1<br />
                2022/23, India: India won 2-1<br />
                This is the first instance of a side winning four successive BGT series.<br /><br />
                <strong>Rohit Sharma:</strong> Was a fantastic series. Right from the word go, how exciting it was. Lot of the players are playing this for the first time. We do understand the importance of this series and the opposition. Lot of hard work has gone into this. At different times we have come up with answers. We knew how important it was to start the series well. The Delhi Test, I am very proud of. We were behind in the game. At Indore, we were put under pressure and lost the game. Different players put their hands up. Lot of guys took up the responsibility and bailed us out. Test Cricket is hard fought cricket and isn't easy. I am quite satisfied. I know what kind of benchmark I have set for myself. I keep the personal milestones aside
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Ravichandran Ashwin:</strong> It has been a great journey. We (himself and Jadeja) started a long time ago but we wouldn't be the same or lethal enough without the other. We need to recognise that, at least I have started recognising that over the last 2-3 years. He gives me a lot of freedom to be creative with the ball, credit to him, I thought he bowled beautifully in the Delhi Test as well and that's why we are here today. Jaddu keeps it really simple, he does not fret around or bother about what has happened, but I saw him sit in one place for an hour after he got out, so that told me how disappointed he was and that came out today. The conversations have been a lot more in the last 2-3 years because I know how to communicate and what are his likes, his dislikes and even knowing what will help him. Even he has adapted beautifully to the chop and change, during the series when Head was going, Khawaja was playing, we had a lot of good conversations and some of them ended up with wickets and some of them are quite funny.

                That's another Test in this series which has finished within three days. And it was Australia who came out on top. They might not have a chance to win the series but there's still a chance to draw it and if this game's performance is anything to go by then we can expect an even contest in Ahmedabad. Both teams have almost a week to prepare for that Test and hopefully it will be a fitting finale to what has been a superb series. So, that's a wrap for now. This is Akshay Maanay signing off on behalf of Raju Peethala, Sagar Chawla and Mukesh. Cheers!
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Nathan Lyon | Player of the Match:</strong> It has been a pretty remarkable Test series. But to come out here and put a really good team performance that is something I am really proud about. Today to see the boys get there one down is pretty special. I don't have all the tricks or all the trades in the game but one thing I do have is belief in my stock ball and that is the biggest thing in world cricket, if you believe in your best ball then you can challenge the best players in the world for longer periods of time. I don't think I have mastered it (bowling to Indian batters), I have been lucky enough to get some of the best players like Virat and Pujara and the others, I just love challenging myself at this level and get a big thrill out of that.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Steve Smith:</strong> Everything I guess (on what he attributes the win to). The first day losing the toss, having to bowl first.. Our bowlers got the ball in the right areas and put India under pressure. I thought Kuhnemann was really good on the first day. All our bowlers contributed and bowled in partnerships, first innings Usman was outstanding and he's been really good for us this series. Yesterday India fought back and I thought we had to toil really hard, Puji played an outstanding innings but we really stuck at it, Nathan got all the rewards with 8 wickets but I think our bowlers as a collective were really good. It was a complete performance. We are thinking about Patty, who's gone back home, our thoughts are with him. I really enjoyed it and like captaining in this part of the world as I understand the conditions really well. There's an event every ball and a lot different to the other parts of the world, and I did a reasonable job this week. Much the same, we will wait and see what the conditions are like, but we are really proud to clinch a spot in the WTC final. Hopefully we can put a similar performance and draw the series.
                <br />
                <strong> Rohit Sharma:</strong> When you lose a Test match, there are a lot of things which didn't go our way, to start with we didn't bat well in the 1st innings, we understand how important it is to put runs on the board in the 1st innings and when they got 80-90 runs lead, we had to produce another innings with the bat but we were not able to do that again. We got just 75 on the board, if we batted well in the 1st innings, things would have been slightly different. We haven't thought about it yet (WCT final), we have sometime to think about what we need to do there (Ahmedabad Test). We need to regroup and try and understand what we did right in the first 2 games. We need to understand, no matter what the pitches are, you gotta come out and do the job. We need to keep it simple and follow the plan. When you are playing on challenging pitches, we need to be brave. We allowed their bowlers to bowl on one particular spot. Not taking any credit away from their bowlers. especially Nathan Lyon, he kept challenging us hitting the right lengths. When the bowler is trying to do that, gotta be a little brave which I thought we were not. Things happen like that, but we can take a lot of credit about how we batted in the first 2 games. Its all about everyone coming together and chipping in. We want few guys stand up and put their hand up to take the team through. You will falter in your plans and that's what happened in this game, we didn't adapt as well as we would have liked to.

                India take a 1-0 lead in the 3-match series in Mumbai which doled out a lively surface. While Australia collapsed 129/2 to 188/10, India recovered from 83/5 with an unbeaten 108-run partnership. The hosts will further be bolstered by captain Rohit Sharma's return for the next game. Can the Aussies level the series? Tune in on Sunday for the second game in Visakhapatnam. For now, it's goodbye from<strong> Abhinand Raghavendran, Abhinav Guha, Saurabh Shankar</strong> and <strong>Praveen</strong>.
                <br /> <br /> <strong>Ravinda Jadeja | Player of the Match:</strong> I’m playing ODI cricket after 8 months so I was just looking to adapt to the format as soon as possible. Luckily with the ball, I got a few wickets. When I went to bat, I was looking to build a partnership with KL. I knew that the total was small but still we had to chase it down. We've been playing Test cricket. Line and length is different to Test cricket. You have to alter you lengths and pace. I was looking to bowl in good areas and I was also getting a bit of turn. I was looking to build a partnership today of about 70-80 runs, and that's what happened. It was not easy to play the big shots because the ball was swinging.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Hardik Pandya | India captain:</strong> We were under pressure both the times . We kept our composure and found ways to come out of those situations. Once we got the momentum towards us, we were quite on top of the game. I am really proud of the way we caught today. The number of chances we created ... they had to be taken. Outstanding catches by Jaddu and Shubman as well. Talking about Jaddu, he did what he's capable of. Coming after a break in ODI cricket, the way he finished as well, we needed a partnership with KL and he did the job for us. That was fantastic. It was hot, I was enjoying my bowling. I was enjoying my batting as well. The way KL and Jaddu finished it off and the way they batted, it gave us the confidence. It was very relaxing watching them bat. Overall, a very good victory and very proud of them.

                <strong>Steve Smith | Australia captain:</strong>We weren't expecting this at the Wankhede, usually pretty good scores. India bowled really well. We probably left a few out there. If we had got over 250, it would have been interesting the way the ball was swinging and seaming. KL and Jaddu's partnership was really good when they were under pressure. We started pretty well. Mitch played really nicely and took the game on early and got a few away and kept going. We lost too many wickets through the middle. We weren't able to get a partnership and get to a reasonable total. We were always one partnership away from them beating us. Jadeja and Rahul showed how to do it. Maybe 260-270 (was a par score). I don't think it was a great wicket, it was offering a fair bit for the seamers at times. The ball swung pretty much for 30-odd overs for both teams. We just needed to score more runs. Credit to India.

                India have been blown away. There were chances of rain. But India were hit by a couple of storms. First Starc and then Marsh. The Indian batting order donned a brittle look and Starc used the moving ball like a scalpel to scathe open some wounds of the Indian team. Marsh further rubbed salt with his pulverizing display when they were chasing. India were never in the game once they lost the toss. They will have to rinse this off as they move further south to Chennai for the decider. Australia have their tails up and would look to continue their dominant display. We have had immense fun in bringing this to you. This is<strong> Kumar Abhisekh Das, Abhinand Raghavendran, Saurabh Shankar</strong> and <strong>Mukesh Gowda </strong> saying you ta ta!
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Mitchell Starc | Player of the Match:</strong> I have learnt the trade over the years. My rhythm has been good for a few weeks now. Last couple of nights, I got the ball to shape in the air and do a little bit off the wicket. Feeling in a good place, hopefully I can continue. It's a role I play, being more attacking and bowling slightly fuller than some of the other guys. I can be slightly more expensive, but that brings in all the dismissals more, that's the role I play. My conversations are a little different compared to someone like a Cam Green. Both the decks have helped the seamers.There was movement in the air in Mumbai as well. My game plan is to attack the stumps and bring in all modes of dismissal into play.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Steve Smith | Australia captain:</strong>Was a quick one. Only 37 overs you don't see that too often. Starc, with the new ball, put them under pressure. It was a nice start to the day. I didn't know how the wicket was going to play. There was no real total in mind. It was about going out there and executing our skills and hopefully putting Indians under pressure, fortunately we were able to do that. It was one of those days and we were on the right side of it. Just that kind of a day when the nicks went to hand. The way Head and Marsh played at the start, they just kept going and we were able to bounce back after the last game. Don't know about the catch of the century. Nice that I held on today. Fortunate I was able to hang on to it. It was a big wicket, Hardik is an unbelievable player

                <br /><br />
                <strong>Rohith Sharma | India captain:</strong>If you lose a game, it is just disappointing. We didn't apply ourselves with the bat. Didn't put enough runs on the board. It wasn't a 117 wicket. Kept losing wickets and that didn't allow us to get the runs we wanted. Once we lost Shubman in the first over, myself and Virat got 30-35 runs quickly. But then I lost my wicket and we lost we lost a couple of wickets back to back. That put us on the back foot. It's always tough to come back from that situation. Today wasn't the day for us. Starc is a quality bowler. He has been doing it for Australia with the new ball. He kept bowling to his strength. Swung the new ball and took the odd ball away. Kept the batters guessing. Marsh has to be one of the top players going around when it comes to power hitting. He backs himself to do that every now and then. Definitely in top 3 and 4 when it comes to power hitting.
                <br /><br />What went wrong for India? They lost Gill early. Then a flurry of fours. But post that the wickets carnival never ended to India's bemusement. Starc was amongst the wickets and pocketed a fifer. India were just hapless and folded up for 117. Post that, it was the Marsh-Head show.
